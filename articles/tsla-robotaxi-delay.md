Tesla once again pushed back its full self-driving and robotaxi timeline,
citing a need for additional validation, regulatory clarity, and model refinement.

The *core issue* is not just engineering complexity—it is investor psychology.

For years, a meaningful portion of Tesla’s valuation has been tied to:
- Future robotaxi networks
- High-margin software revenue
- Optionality around energy + autonomy platforms

Each delay incrementally erodes confidence that these cash flows will materialize
on the originally implied schedule.

Short-term reaction:
- Elevated volatility
- Multiple compression risk vs. other large-cap growth names

Longer-term, bulls argue that:
> “If Tesla solves autonomy even 3–5 years late, the payoff is still enormous.”

The market, however, is starting to demand **proof over promises**, which is why
today’s news screens as **meaningfully negative** on near-term sentiment.
