Apple issued softer-than-expected guidance for its services and cloud-adjacent
revenue streams, raising questions about high-margin growth durability.

While iPhone unit demand remains stable, investors are recalibrating expectations
around:

- **App Store take rate trends**
- **iCloud and subscription attach rates**
- Cross-selling opportunities into productivity and AI services

For the broader cloud ecosystem, the read-through is mixed:

- Bear case: weaker consumer cloud growth pressures valuation multiples
- Bull case: enterprises like Microsoft remain better insulated due
  to diversified productivity and infrastructure revenue

Net effect: the update is interpreted as **modestly negative for AAPL**
and **slightly cautious but not thesis-breaking for MSFT**.
