NVIDIA and Palantir today announced a deeper expansion of their existing
collaboration around enterprise-scale artificial intelligence.

The partnership integrates **NVIDIA’s accelerated computing stack** with
**Palantir’s AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform)**, enabling customers
to deploy advanced AI workloads across defense, healthcare, finance,
and public-sector operations.

For investors, the key question is whether this deal leads to:
- Higher AI infrastructure spend benefiting NVDA’s data center segment
- Increased platform stickiness and deal flow for Palantir

Early sell-side commentary frames the news as a *moderately positive*
catalyst for both NVDA and PAL, with upside skewed toward
longer-duration enterprise AI contracts rather than immediate revenue spikes.
