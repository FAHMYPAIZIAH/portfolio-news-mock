This is the **live demo article** you can edit in real time during the
hackathon presentation.

The Federal Reserve released commentary suggesting a faster-than-expected
pivot toward rate cuts, citing:

- Cooling inflation in core goods
- Early signs of labor-market softening
- Rising stress in parts of the credit market

For your portfolio, the high-level narrative is:

- **Growth and AI-heavy names (like NVDA)** often benefit from lower discount
  rates and easier financial conditions.
- **Mega-cap platforms (like AAPL)** may see a smaller but still positive
  valuation tailwind.
- **High-beta names (like TSLA)** may react strongly in the short term but
  remain sensitive to execution headlines and positioning.
